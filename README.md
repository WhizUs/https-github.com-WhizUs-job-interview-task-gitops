# GitOps Approach on Exoscale

In this task we will look at the case of building a Kubernetes cluster on Exoscale - a cloud provider in the DACH region - and then deploying applications in the cluster using GitOps approach.


## Guidance

1. Create an Exoscale account
2. Use the existing terraform code to deploy the Kubernetes Cluster
3. Read [the story](STORY.md)
4. Read the HOWTOs.
5. Read the NOTES
6. Deploy missing components if required.


## Additional task

* Maybe you can help the guys with the backlog :)

## Notes

* To create your Exoscale account, use an Exoscale voucher you received from WhizUs.
